Title: "Calculator Project: C Programming Language, AVR Microcontroller, and Protus Simulation"

Post:

As a developer and enthusiast of embedded systems, I'm excited to share my latest project: a calculator program using the C programming language, AVR microcontroller, and Protus simulation. This project demonstrates the versatility of C programming and the capabilities of AVR microcontrollers in embedded systems development.

The Project:

Using the C programming language, I developed a calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is designed to run on an AVR microcontroller, which provides a robust and reliable platform for embedded systems development.

To simulate the program's behavior, I used Protus to create a virtual environment that mimics the behavior of the AVR microcontroller. This allows me to test and debug the program without the need for physical hardware.

Features:

The calculator program features include:

Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
Support for decimal points and negative numbers
Error handling for invalid input
User-friendly interface with clear instructions
Technical Details:

Programming language: C
Microcontroller: AVR (ATmega16)
Development environment: Protus
Simulation platform: Protus
Benefits:

This project demonstrates the following benefits:

The C programming language is a versatile and widely-used language that can be applied to a wide range of applications.
The AVR microcontroller is a reliable and robust platform for embedded systems development.
Protus simulation allows for rapid prototyping and testing of embedded systems without the need for physical hardware.
Conclusion:

This project showcases the power of combining C programming language, AVR microcontroller, and Protus simulation to create innovative solutions. By leveraging these tools, we can develop cutting-edge technologies that improve our daily lives and contribute to a more sustainable future.
